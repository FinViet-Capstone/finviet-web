- 2026-08-04 — **Design system tokens + shared components**: replaced globals.css's
  create-next-app defaults with the light-theme tokens from the Pencil design briefs
  (base colors, status colors, radii; dark-mode block removed). Built the 5 shared
  components from `context/designs/web-design`'s Pencil components — Sidebar, Topbar,
  Stat Card, Tab Bar, Confirmation Modal — under `src/components/`, presentational
  only, CSS Modules, minimal `'use client'`. Added `context/ai-design-interactions.md`
  documenting the Pencil-to-code workflow. Merged to main on branch
  `feature/design-system-tokens-components` (deleted after merge).
