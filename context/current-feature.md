# Current Feature

**Admin dashboard review fixes** — a batch of interaction bugs and UX gaps found while walking
through the already-built screens (Overview, Users, System Configuration, Category Corrections,
Knowledge Base, Announcements, topbar/sidebar). Not a new screen — fixes and small additions
across existing ones, tracked in the approved plan
(`C:\Users\Lenovo\.claude\plans\sparkling-spinning-russell.md`) rather than a design brief, since
this pass started from live bug reports instead of a Pencil mockup.

## Status

In progress — implementation done, build + browser verification next.

## Goals

- Sidebar nav items were plain `<div>`s with no `href`/`onClick` → real `next/link`s.
- Overview trend charts: leftmost X-axis label was clipped (centered off-canvas) → edge-aware
  tick anchoring + `user-select: none` on the chart wrapper.
- Topbar: removed the non-functional search icon; moved the admin avatar out of the topbar into a
  new pinned bottom section of the sidebar, with a dropdown (Tài khoản của tôi / Đăng xuất — mock
  redirect to `/login`). Added a visual-only "Tài khoản của tôi" account panel.
- Announcements: removed the disabled "Phân khúc (sắp ra mắt)" target option (segment targeting
  is spec'd as TBD, not worth showing a dead control for).
- Users: pagination didn't slice the table at all (buttons just moved the highlight) → expanded
  mock data to 40 rows and made pagination real (10/page, dynamic page count, resets on filter
  change).
- System Configuration → Buckets: removed the Needs/Wants edit lock per product direction (admin
  should be able to edit all buckets); added sortOrder-uniqueness validation on save (previously
  two buckets could silently share the same order).
- System Configuration → Categories: added an SVG upload dropzone for custom category icons
  (alongside the 5 existing presets); renamed "Bắt buộc" → "Mặc định" to match its real meaning
  (seeded into every customer's category library vs. hidden by default) — underlying field stays
  `isMandatory`, matching the real `Category.IsMandatory` backend field.
- System Configuration → Scoring Weights: mock criteria didn't match the real formula in
  `finviet-be`'s `SpendingScoreService.cs` at all (wrong names, wrong weights, one fabricated
  criterion, wrong 0–1 scale). Replaced with the real 3 criteria and weights, added a live formula
  display and a total-weight validation (must sum to 100%). Also flagged that `ScoringCriterion`
  isn't actually read by the real scoring service yet — see `context/backend-gaps.md`.
- System Configuration → Plans: "Xóa" was a hard delete from the mock array despite the confirm
  copy already promising existing subscribers are unaffected. Changed to a soft-delete
  ("Ngừng cung cấp") — the plan stays in the list with an "Đã ngừng" badge instead of disappearing.
- Category Correction Log: added a client-side "Xuất CSV" export button for the filtered rows.
- Knowledge Base: added a "Xem trước" preview button per ready document (metadata-only, since no
  real file content exists anywhere in the current mock/upload flow).
- New `context/backend-gaps.md` documenting every place found where a real endpoint is missing or
  doesn't satisfy the frontend's needs, for the backend team.

All changes are visual/mock-only per `context/ai-design-interactions.md` — no real `finviet-be`
calls added. Built on branch `fix/admin-dashboard-review-fixes`.

## History

<!-- Keep this updated. Earliest to latest -->

- 2026-08-04 — **Design system tokens + shared components**: replaced globals.css's
  create-next-app defaults with the light-theme tokens from the Pencil design briefs
  (base colors, status colors, radii; dark-mode block removed). Built the 5 shared
  components from `context/designs/web-design`'s Pencil components — Sidebar, Topbar,
  Stat Card, Tab Bar, Confirmation Modal — under `src/components/`, presentational
  only, CSS Modules, minimal `'use client'`. Added `context/ai-design-interactions.md`
  documenting the Pencil-to-code workflow. Merged to main on branch
  `feature/design-system-tokens-components` (deleted after merge).
- 2026-08-04 — **Overview screen**: first full screen built in code, matching the
  Pencil mockup and `context/designs/pencil-mock-design.md`. Added the shared
  dashboard shell (`src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` + `sidebar-nav.tsx`, route-aware
  active nav via `usePathname`) and the Overview page itself — 6 stat cards, a
  Free/Premium split card, and 2 trend charts via `recharts` (decision recorded in
  project-spec.md). Wired root `/` to redirect to `/overview` and replaced the
  create-next-app boilerplate homepage/metadata. Built on branch
  `feature/overview-screen`.
- 2026-08-04 — **Login screen**: built `src/app/login/page.tsx` matching the Pencil mockup and
  `context/designs/pencil-mock-design-login.md` — centered card outside the dashboard shell,
  credential step (username/password, show/hide toggle) and 2FA/TOTP step (6-digit segmented
  input with auto-advance focus), both with inline error states. Visual-only per
  `context/ai-design-interactions.md`: no calls to `finviet-be`'s admin-login endpoint or
  better-auth; client-side validation (empty fields / incomplete code) drives the error states
  for demo purposes. Built on branch `feature/login-screen`.
- 2026-08-04 — **Users screen**: built `src/app/(dashboard)/users/page.tsx` matching the Pencil
  mockup and `context/designs/pencil-mock-design-users.md` — toolbar (search + status filter)
  above a paginated customer table with status/plan badges and row actions (lock/unlock,
  password reset), plus the 3 `ConfirmationModal` variants (lock = destructive, unlock/reset =
  primary) reusing the existing shared component. Visual-only per
  `context/ai-design-interactions.md`: mock customer array in `mock-users.ts` with client-side
  search/status filtering and lock-state toggling (no `finviet-be` calls) so all modal states and
  the success toast are reachable for browser verification. Built on branch
  `feature/users-screen`.
- 2026-08-04 — **System Configuration screen**: built `src/app/(dashboard)/system-config/page.tsx`
  matching the Pencil mockup and `context/designs/pencil-mock-design-system-config.md` — a
  4-tab shell (`TabBar`, extended with a new `onSelect` prop since it was presentational-only
  until now) covering Danh mục (table + Add/Edit + destructive delete confirm), Nhóm ngân sách
  (3-row list, Needs/Wants locked with a lock icon + tooltip, Savings editable — matches the
  mockup's "Sửa nhóm ngân sách" example, which is pre-filled with Savings' data), Trọng số điểm
  (inline-editable weight table, per-cell "modified" dot, `Lưu thay đổi` button that only
  appears once dirty, warning-styled `ConfirmationModal` save confirm), and Gói dịch vụ (card
  grid + Add/Edit modal with a feature-bullet editor + destructive delete confirm). Added a new
  shared component, `FormModal` (`src/components/form-modal/`), for the Add/Edit forms, since
  `ConfirmationModal` only covered simple confirm/cancel dialogs. Visual-only per
  `context/ai-design-interactions.md`: mock data per tab (`mock-categories.ts`,
  `mock-buckets.ts`, `mock-scoring.ts`, `mock-plans.ts`) with client-side CRUD/state so every
  modal variant is reachable for browser verification; no `finviet-be` calls. Built on branch
  `feature/system-config-screen`.
- 2026-08-04 — **Category Correction Log screen**: built
  `src/app/(dashboard)/category-corrections/page.tsx` matching the Pencil mockup and
  `context/designs/pencil-mock-design-category-corrections.md` — a filter bar (date range +
  corrected-category dropdown) above a read-only, paginated table (Mô tả giao dịch, AI đề xuất
  muted text, → connector, Đã sửa badge in the category's own catalog color, Khách hàng, Thời
  gian) where clicking a row opens a detail modal (larger AI-guess → corrected comparison,
  amount, customer email, corrected date/time, single `Đóng` button, no edit/save affordance
  anywhere). Reused the `FormModal` shell from System Configuration for the modal. Visual-only
  per `context/ai-design-interactions.md`: mock correction array in `mock-corrections.ts` with
  client-side category filtering (no `finviet-be` calls); no toast, since nothing is ever saved
  on this screen. Built on branch `feature/category-corrections-screen`.
- 2026-08-04 — **AI Knowledge Base screen**: built `src/app/(dashboard)/knowledge-base/page.tsx`
  matching `context/designs/pencil-mock-design-knowledge-base.md` — a header with a top-right
  `+ Tải lên tài liệu` button above a document table (Tiêu đề, Trạng thái badge — green Sẵn sàng
  vs. amber Đang xử lý, both existing tokens (`--color-active`/`--color-warning`), Số đoạn, Ngày
  tải lên) with a per-row `Xóa` action. The upload modal is a 3-state flow: idle (drag-and-drop
  PDF zone + title field, reusing `FormModal`, `Tải lên` disabled until both are set — picking a
  file auto-fills an empty title from the filename), progress (custom shell, no `FormModal`
  header/close button since the upload can't be dismissed mid-flight — a `setInterval`-driven
  fake progress bar), and success (custom shell, checkmark + `Xong` button that adds the new
  "Đang xử lý" row and closes the modal — no toast, the success state is the feedback per the
  brief's micro-interactions). Delete reuses `ConfirmationModal` (destructive) and does show a
  toast, consistent with other screens with real mutations. Visual-only per
  `context/ai-design-interactions.md`: mock document array in `mock-documents.ts`, no
  `finviet-be` calls. Built on branch `feature/knowledge-base-screen`.
- 2026-08-04 — **Announcements screen**: built `src/app/(dashboard)/announcements/page.tsx`
  matching `context/designs/pencil-mock-design-announcements.md` — a compose panel (title input,
  body textarea with a 500-char counter that turns amber near the limit, target selector with
  only `Tất cả người dùng` selectable and `Phân khúc (sắp ra mắt)` disabled) above a read-only
  history table (Tiêu đề, Đối tượng, Số người nhận, Thời gian gửi). `Xem trước` opens a
  `FormModal`-based preview rendering the announcement inside a phone-frame mockup of the mobile
  notification center; `Gửi` opens the existing `ConfirmationModal` (destructive variant, reused
  as-is rather than adding the brief's one-off icon/close-button decoration, to stay consistent
  with every other confirm modal in the app) showing the live target-audience count, and
  confirming adds a new row to the top of the history table, resets the compose form, and shows a
  success toast — matching the pattern established by other screens with real mutations.
  Visual-only per `context/ai-design-interactions.md`: mock announcement array + a fixed mock
  target-audience count in `mock-announcements.ts`, no `finviet-be` calls. Built on branch
  `feature/announcements-screen`.
